6:10	The bus left the station at 	ten past six	 - and she sat proud, like an accustomed traveller, apart from her father, John Henry, and Berenice.

6:21	The whipped mules dragged the wagon on through a flooded branch that submerged thirty yards of the road and stood up around the bushes and tree-trunks on either side so that they had no rootage, and I watched where and how deep the wheels went while I idled the motor and lighter Gudger's and my own cigarette.

6:30	Six-thirty was clearly a preposterous time and he, the client, obviously hadn't meant it seriously.

6:30	Sometimes they were hooded carts, sometimes they were just open carts, with planks for seats, on which sat twelve cloaked and bonneted women, six a side, squeezed together, for the interminable journey. As late as 1914 I knew the carrier of Croydon-cum-Clopton, twelve miles from Cambridge; his cart started at 	6.3	0 in the morning and got back at about ten at night.

6:35	My watch lay on the dressing-table close by; glancing at it, I saw that the time was 	twenty-five minutes to seven	.

6:45	As the clock pointed to a 	quarter to seven	, the dog woke and shook himself.

6:50	That night I lay in my jangling single bed across from Sammy’s and I watched him sleep, and then I stared at the ceiling. I got up and took a blanket and went and made a cup of tea, and lay on the sofa and tried to read one of the wrinkled paperbacks. I blinked my way through a hallucinatory half chapter, set it aside and closed my eyes. I woke and it was 	six fifty	, and I winced my way upstairs and lay down in my bed, to be there when Sammy woke up again.	The Body Lies	Jo Baker

7:00	Anne made her way across the dooryard, trailing a steadying hand along the side of Bobbi’s truck. When she had passed the truck, she reached at once for the porch railing.

7:00	Grant immediately understood the advantages. It was now 	seven o’clock in the morning	. They had at least eight miles to go. If they could take a raft along the river, they would make much faster progress than going overland.	Jurassic Park	Michael Crichton
7:00	Through September and right into October, the North Carolina skies were clear and the air was warm even at 	seven in the morning	, when I left my second-floor apartment by the outside stairs.

7:00	The call was early: 	seven AM	, two hours before the park opened its doors on another summer. The three of us walked down the beach together. Tom talked most of the way. He always talked. It would have been wearisome if he hadn’t been so amusing and relentlessly cheerful.	Joyland	Stephen King

7:00	In his hotel room at the Bon Voyage, Dr. Rufus Sixsmith reads a sheaf of letters written to him nearly half a century ago by his friend Robert Frobisher.

At 	seven o’clock	 precisely, he washes, changes his shirt, and sandwiches the nine read letters in the Gideon’s Bible—this he replaces in the bedside cabinet. Sixsmith slips the unread letters into his jacket pocket for the restaurant.	Cloud Atlas	David Mitchell
7:00	This morning everything is clean; the storm has left branches strewn around the yard, which I will presently go out and pick up: all the beach’s sand has been redistributed and laid down fresh in an even blanket pocked with impressions of rain, and the daylilies bend and glisten in the white 	seven a.m.	 light.

He imagined that someone was to be tortured, and he dreaded hearing the first screams of pain. When the footsteps reached his own section, he saw through the eye hole that guards were serving breakfast. Rubashov did not receive any breakfast because he had reported himself ill. He began to pace up and down the cell, six and a half steps to the window, six and a half steps back.	Darkness at Noon	Arthur Koestler
7:00	I had left directions that I was to be called at 	seven	; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments, only, could be taken.

7:05	He really couldn't believe that the old woman who'd phoned him last night would show up this morning, as she'd said she would.

For the first time in his life, Jack Ryan fell asleep on an airplane.	The Hunt for Red October	Tom Clancy

The Green Mile	Stephen King
7:07	Qantas Flight 102 touched down at Melbourne Airport at 	seven minutes past seven	. Charlie was the first off the aircraft, running as fast as he could, but having to lug Cathy’s picture under one arm slowed him down and made it possible for several other passengers, who obviously had the same idea, to overtake him.

7:13	It was all the more surprising and indeed alarming a little later, said Austerlitz, when I looked out of the corridor window of my carriage just before the train left at 	seven-thirteen	, to find it dawning upon me with perfect certainty that I had seen the pattern of glass and steel roof above the platforms before.

8:00	By 	eight o'clock	 Stillman would come out, always in his long brown overcoat, carrying a large, old-fashioned carpet bag. For two weeks this routine did not vary.

City of Glass	Paul Auster
8:00	Dressed in sweater, anorak and long johns, he lay in bed, hemmed in on three sides by chunky wooden beams, and ate all the salted snacks in the minibar, and then all the sugary snacks, and when he was woken by reception 	at eight	 the following morning to be told that everyone was waiting for him downstairs, the wrapper of a Mars bar was still folded in his fist.

8:00	The next morning I woke up at 	oh eight oh oh hours	, my brothers, and as I still felt shagged and fagged and fashed and bashed and as my glazzies were stuck together real horrorshow with sleepglue, I thought I would not go to school.	A Clockwork Orange	Anthony Burgess
8:00	Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky--Stiva, as he was called in the fashionable world-- woke up at his usual hour, that is, at 	eight o'clock	 in the morning, not in his wife's bedroom, but on the leather-covered sofa in his study.	Anna Karenina	Leo Tolstoy
8:00	It was a fine summer morning. The hands of the Dutch clock in the hall pointed to thirteen minutes past nine; those of the ormolu clock in the sitting-room to eleven minutes past ten; those of the carriage clock on the bookshelf to fourteen minutes to six. In other words, it was 	exactly eight	; and Mrs. Hignett acknowledged the fact by moving her head on the pillow, opening her eyes, and sitting up in bed. She always woke at eight precisely.	Three Men and a Maid	P.G. Wodehouse
8:00	When he opened the windows in the morning, the sky was as overcast as it had been, but the air seemed fresher, and regret set in. Had giving notice not been impetuous and wrongheaded, the result of an inconsequential indisposition? If he had held off a bit, if he had not been so quick to lose heart, if he had instead tried to adjust to the air or wait for the weather to improve, he would now have been free of stress and strain and looking forward to a morning on the beach like the one the day before. Too late. He must go on wanting what he had wanted yesterday. He dressed and rode down to the ground floor at 	eight	 for breakfast.	Death in Venice	Thomas Mann
8:00	Crowley liked the city in the early morning. Its population consisted almost entirely of people who had proper jobs to do and real reasons for being there, as opposed to the unnecessary millions who trailed in after 	8 A.M.	, and the streets were more or less quiet.

8:03	Yes, well. Obviously she's dead and it's very recent. Within the last two hours, if you press me. But you must have come to that conclusion yourselves or you wouldn't have cut her down. When did you say you found her? 	Three minutes after eight	.	Death of an Expert Witness	P.D. James
8:03	 <br>People in Evanston moved so goddamn slow. it was one thing when the sidewalks were covered in ice and lake-effect snow.

They both had very fetching hats, with one flower apiece, but the prettiness of their faces made you think it was more. For some reason they both wore white rosettes pinned to their dresses. I looked again at the clock: 	eight-eleven	.	The Blackpool Highflyer	Andrew Martin
8:12	At 	8:12 a.m.	, just before the moment of pff, all the business of the cellars was being transacted - garbage transferred from small cans into large ones; early wide-awake grandmas, rocky with insomnia, dumped wash into the big tubs; boys in swimming trunks rolled baby carriages out into the cool morning.

I sit down on a mossy wooden bench and look at a nearby bush covered in white flowers. Mm. Pretty. Now what? What do people do in their gardens? I feel I should have something to read. Or someone to call. My fingers are itching to move. I look at my watch. Still only 	eight sixteen	. Oh God.	The Undomestic Goddess	Sophie Kinsella

So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish	Douglas Adams

13:35	<br>Katelyn stood in the hallway, her hands on her hips, enjoying the hell out of the moment. “So I see how it is,” she said. “Your cousin can visit during finals week but my sister can’t.”	1:35 P.M.		Kitchens of the Great Midwest	J. Ryan Stradal
13:37	He had not dared to sleep in his rented car—you didn't sleep in your car when you worked for Jesus Castro—and he was beginning to hallucinate. Still, he was on the job, and he scribbled in his notebook: 	1.37 pm	 Subject appears to be getting laid.	Light House	William Monahan
13:38	According to the digital readout inside my helmet, it was only 	13:38	 LT. The news that I wouldn't have to devote another three hours to painstaking cleanup should have cheered me considerably; instead, it rendered me about twenty times more suspicious.	Sunday Night Yams at Minnie and Earl's	Adam-Troy Castro
13:39	And it was now 	1.39 p.m.	 which was 23 minutes after the stop, which meant that we would be at the sea if the train didn't go in a big curve. But I didn't know if it went in a big curve.	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Mark Haddon
13:40	Glancing at his watch, Chandler-Powell saw that it was 	one-forty	. Perhaps he should now have a word with the Bostocks, who were closeted in the kitchen. He needed to check again that Kimberly had fully recovered and that they were giving thought to food.	The Private Patient	P.D. James
13:41	I will begin a few minutes before the leak started - at 1:41 pm, 13:41 Universal Time - one hour and twenty three minutes ago. At that point the chief flight engineer was attempting to discover why the engines had gone into automatic shutdown.	1:41 PM		Bones Burnt Black	Stephen Euin Cobb
13:42	<br>Behind Chapin Hall was the official campus rehearsal and practice space building for more music students.

Ryan Stradal
13:42	The last note was recorded at 	1.42 pm	: G.M. on site at H-by; will take over the matter.	The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo	Stieg Larsson
13:43	There's a train at 	seventeen minutes to two	, said Didier. He blessed himself and got to his feet. He hesitated.<br/>"What's the matter?"<br/>"Shouldn't we say goodbye to Grandpa? He usually has a cheque for me."	The Public Prosecutor	Jef Geeraerts
13:44	By good luck, the next train was due at 	forty-four minutes past one	, and arrived at Yateland (the next station) ten minutes afterward.	Mr. Policeman and the Cook	Wilkie Collins

13:53	Mr. Jackson, exclaimed Mr. Rossiter. "I really must ask you to be good enough to come in from your lunch at the proper time. It was fully 	seven minutes to two	 when you returned, and-"	Psmith in the City	P.G. Wodehouse

13:55	At 	1:55	 he returned to the insurance records until the fifteen-minute tea break at four o’clock, which was another ritual occasion for two more cigarettes.	Broken Routine	Jeffrey Archer
13:55	If I was punctual in quitting Mlle. Reuter's domicile, I was at least equally punctual in arriving there; I came the next day at 	five minutes before two	, and on reaching the schoolroom door, before I opened it, I heard a rapid, gabbling sound, which warned me that the "priere du midi" was not yet concluded.	The Professor	Charlotte Brontë
13:56	<br>Happily, Katelyn was out of the dorm room, off doing whatever the hell she did on campus, so Braque could type her computer passwords for Eva without worrying about her cooze of a roommate getting them.	1:56 P.M.		Kitchens of the Great Midwest	J. Ryan Stradal
13:57	Then I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. It was 	one fifty-seven	. Twenty-five minutes had vanished somewhere. Not bad, I told myself. A pointless way of whittling away time. Not bad at all.	Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami
13:57	It was 	three minutes to two	. "I hope you can catch him, then. Thank you. I really appreciate it."	Urban Shaman	C.E. Murphy

13:58	It was 	almost two o’clock	, but nothing moved, Stari Teočak was silent and so empty it seemed abandoned, and yet Tijmen constantly felt he was being observed by invisible eyes.	King of Tuzla	Arnold Jansen op de Haar
13:59	For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, and close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. "	One ... fifty-nine	 …"	So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish	Douglas Adams
14:00	“Where exactly? And when? We’ll need to be there.” <br/> “The square. On the steps of the old library.” She glanced to the clock above the pub. “	Two hours past midday	, I believe.”	From These Dark Depths	Vanessa Rasanen

14:00	There was a most friendly parting, and when she sailed, 	two hours after noon	, all the Dufflepuds paddled out with her to the harbor mouth, and cheered until she was out of the sound of their cheering.	The Voyage of the Dawn Treader	C.S. Lewis
14:00	Mrs. Karlsson's eyes were big with surprise when at 	two o'clock	 she saw the pastor coming to dinner in this civilian elegance, which besides the suit and red tie, included colored socks and tan shoes. He offered no word of explanation. As usual, he carried under his arm a book with some unintelligible title, and from which he read the entire meal.	The Hammer of God	Bo Giertz
14:00	Jesiba didn’t bother answering, instead saying, “I’ve got a client coming in at 	two o’clock	. Be ready. And stop letting Lehabah prattle. She has a job to do.” The line went dead.	House of Earth and Blood	Sarah J. Maas

14:00	It’s only 	two o’clock	. She left the office early, telling Dr. Van Vleet she felt she was coming down with something. Really it’s Nate who is coming down with something: he phones from his house, nasal, forlorn, he has to see her.	Life Before Man	Margaret Atwood
14:00	It’s a delusional painter who finishes a canvas at 	two o’clock	 and expects radical societal transformation by four. Even when artists write manifestos, they are (hopefully) aware that their exigent tone is, finally, borrowed, only echoing and mimicking the urgency of the guerrilla’s demands, or the activist’s protests, rather than truly enacting it. The people sometimes demand change. They almost never demand art.	Intimations	Zadie Smith
14:00	Things started to break up around 	two in the afternoon	. We could have stayed for supper, could have stayed - if Mr Corcoran’s drunken invitations held true (Mrs Corcoran’s frosty smile behind his back informed us that they did not) indefinitely.	The Secret History	Donna Tartt
14:00	At 	2 p.m.	 on a weekday, the movie theater was almost deserted, but three people sat two rows back from Andi Steiner and her date.

Her cheekbones were high, her eyes were gray, her complexion creamy. Her masses of black hair were tied back with a broad velvet ribbon.	Doctor Sleep	Stephen King
14:00	At 	two	 every afternoon, the mother and son would appear at the beach. The mother always wore a plain light-colored dress with a broad-brimmed straw hat.

Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami
14:00	“You can take a nap in my room,” she said. “It should be quiet down there. My relatives are over, but they won’t think you’re being rude or anything. We don’t have to be at the funeral home until 	two	.”	My Year of Rest and Relaxation	Ottessa Moshfegh
14:00	We followed along the High Street at a reasonable distance, giggling, dodging past people, separating and coming together again. It must have been around 	two o’clock	 by then, and the pavement was busy with shoppers.	Never Let Me Go	Kazuo Ishiguro
14:00	The next few hours are shutter-snaps. Pictures like on her phone. She blinks and there’s a picture. Blinks again and there’s something else.

14:00	At 	two o’clock	 the doctor begins to squirm around in his chair. The meetings are uncomfortable for the doctor unless he’s talking about his theory; he’d rather spend his time down in his office, drawing on graphs.	One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest	Ken Kesey
14:00	He told her if he had any of his weekends free he’d ask her for a date, and she said she could come to visit in two weeks if he’d tell her what time, and Billy looked at McMurphy for an answer.

14:00	One afternoon, I don’t recall how long back, we stopped on our way to activities and sat around the lobby on the big plastic sofas or outside in the 	two-o’clock	 sun while one of the black boys used the phone to call his bookmaker, and Billy’s mother took the opportunity to leave her work and come out from behind her desk and take her boy by the hand and lead him outside to sit near where I was on the grass.	One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest	Ken Kesey
14:00	As Big Ben struck 	two o’clock	 the door opened and the top half of Cleverly’s body appeared. “Anything?”<br>“No, sir.”<br>“The line still working?”<br>“I believe so.”<br>“We’ll give it another five minutes and then the PM will have to go.”<br>The door closed.	Munich	Robert Harris
14:00	At 	two o’clock	 back at the Weatherbys’ Sally asked her if she and Amory had had a “time” in the den. Isabelle turned to her quietly. In her eyes was the light of the idealist, the inviolate dreamer of Joan-like dreams.	This Side of Paradise	F. Scott Fitzgerald
14:00	“How odd… I’m almost happy. And yet I suppose I’m actually in danger… Somehow - now - nothing seems to matter… not in daylight… I feel full of power - I feel that I can’t die…”<br>Blore was looking at his wrist-watch. He said:<br>“It’s 	two o’clock	. What about lunch?”	And Then There Were None	Agatha Christie
14:00	She could have fired the jig, and he could have kept on picking up his packages at the old time, 	two o'clock	. As it was, he had almost been arrested.	A Confederacy of Dunces	John Kennedy Toole
14:00	At approximately 	1400 hours	 a pair of enemy Skyhawks came flying in at deck level out of nowhere.	Black Swan Green	David Mitchell

14:00	I caught the 	two o'clock	 bus. It was very hot. I ate at Céleste's restaurant as usual. They all felt very sorry for me and Céleste told me, "There's no one like a mother."	The Outsider	Albert Camus
14:00	The Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers. With the 	two o'clock	 bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can spend the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by tomorrow evening.	The Outsider	Albert Camus
14:00	When Salander woke up it was 	2	.00 on Saturday afternoon and a doctor was poking at her.	The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest	Stieg Larsson

14:01	The next day was Saturday and, now that Moon was done, I decided to bring the job to its end. So I sent word that I shouldn't be able to umpire for the team at Steeple Sinderby and, after working through the morning, came down 	about two o'clock	.	A Month in the Country	J.L. Carr
14:01	The express departed from Birmingham with the nicest exactitude, and covered itself with glory as far as Watford, when it ran into a mist, and lost more than a quarter of an hour, besides ruining Arthur's career. Arthur arrived in London at 	one minute past two	.	Catching the Train	Arnold Bennet
14:02	At the fatal stroke of the clock the whole assembly rushed from their places as if a fire had broken out.

14:02	I'm not dead. How did that happen? He was right. It was 	14.02	 and twenty-six seconds. Destiny had not been fulfilled. We all looked at each other, confused.	The Woman Who Died a Lot	Jasper Fforde
14:03	It was 	three minutes after two in the afternoon	, and the Battle of Tahuma had begun.	The Infinite Day	Chris Walley
14:04	. Once again, the Quartermaster-General's office came on the line asking for Colonel Finckh, and once again Finckh heard the quiet, unemotional, unfamiliar voice	2.04 pm		The Night of the Generals	Hans Hellmut Kirst
14:05	...and at 	five past two	 on 17 September of that same unforgettable year 1916, I was in the Muryovo hospital yard, standing on trampled withered grass, flattened by the September rain.	A Country Doctor's Notebook	Mikhail Bulgakov

14:10	Mrs. Eunice Harris pulls back the sleeve of her good coat and checks her good watch. "Indeed yes. Half twelve," and waves a hand at the Town Hall clock as if it was hers. "Always 	ten past two	. Someone put a nail in the time years back."	The Coward's Tale	Vanessa Gebbie
14:11	The phone machine announced in an electronic voice, "You have one message, at 	two-eleven P.M.	" <br/> Then an unctuous male voice came on. "Kirby, we know you're there. You're still in treatment. You shouldn't be wandering around unsupervised. It's a lot better, a lot safer, for you to stay with us now."	Syndrome	Thomas Hoover
14:12	Seb looked up at the clock on the wall: 	2:12 p.m.	 At this rate, he’d be lucky to get more than forty minutes with Mellor, although he suspected the man would have his pitch well prepared and wouldn’t waste any time.	This Was a Man	Jeffrey Archer
14:12	However, they should not forget that another man had lost his life, and if Danny Cartwright did not kill Bernie Wilson, they might well ask, who else could possibly have committed the crime?<br/>At 	twelve minutes past two	, the jury filed out of the court to begin their deliberations.	A Prisoner of Birth	Jeffrey Archer
14:13	At the third stroke, it will be 	two ... thirteen	 ... and fifty seconds.	So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish	Douglas Adams

14:15	I had a date with her next day at 	2.15 P.M.	 In my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight.	Lolita	Vladimir Nabokov
14:15	 Second afternoon class	2.15 p.m.		The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Mark Haddon

14:18	<br/>Pierre Armont was forty-six, with gray temples and a body appropriate to an Olympic wrestler. He had full cheeks, a heavy mustache, and suspicious dark eyes that constantly searched his surroundings. It was an innate survival instinct.	2:18 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover

14:20	He checked his watch: 	2:20 p.m.	 Kickoff at 3:00. Forty thousand fans were all heading in the same direction. The majority were wearing red-and-white scarves, although a large contingent wore blue-and-white.	Turn a Blind Eye	Jeffrey Archer
14:20	. Want to go back to the hotel for a while?<br/>"All right."<br/>They walked out of the gardens and down the rue de Vaugirard.

14:25	There was a moment today, at 	2:25	, when study hall came suddenly to life. Heads were lifted and cocked as the siren in the belfry of the city hall announced trouble, probably a fire, somewhere in Staggerford.	Staggerford	Jon Hassler
14:25	The three of us mooched about the office, making aimless conversation, glancing with studied carelessness into the front street, whistling little tunes to ourselves. By 	two twenty-five	 we had all fallen silent.	All Things Bright and Beautiful	James Herriot
14:25	Gary shut himself inside his office and flipped through the messages. Caroline had called at 1:35, 1:40, 1:50, 1:55, and 2:10; it was now 	2:25	. He pumped his fist in triumph. Finally, finally, some evidence of desperation.	The Corrections	Jonathan Franzen

Millie	Katherine Mansfield

14:32	Like 	2.32 p.m.	, Beecher and Avalon, L3 R2 (which meant left three blocks, right two) 2:35 p.m., and you wondered how you could pick up one box, then drive 5 blocks in 3 minutes and be finished cleaning out another box.	Post Office	Charles Bukowski
14:33	At that moment his aunt appeared at the side of her cottage and gazed up the headland. Dalgliesh glanced at his wrist. It was 	thirty-three minutes past two	. He let in the clutch and the Cooper Bristol bumped slowly down the track towards her.	Unnatural Causes	P.D. James
14:34	At 	two thirty-four p.m.	, precisely, in the largest and most luxurious of the private rooms, Sister Brumfett lost a patient. She always thought of death that way.

14:35	Like 2.32 p.m., Beecher and Avalon, L3 R2 (which meant left three blocks, right two) 	2:35 p.m.	, and you wondered how you could pick up one box, then drive 5 blocks in 3 minutes and be finished cleaning out another box.	Post Office	Charles Bukowski
14:36	“Drive safe,” says Ned. He texted me to send the van. That was at 	2:36	, I know because I looked at the clock, the art deco one right over there, see? Keeps perfect time. Then, I dunno, he just vanished.	Stone Mattress	Margaret Atwood
14:36	I look at my watch. 	Two thirty-six	. All I've got left today is take in the laundry and fix dinner.	The Elephant Vanishes	Haruki Murakami
14:37	However, what he hadn’t anticipated was that it would stop at every station from Finsbury Park to Stevenage, so by the time the train finally puffed into Cambridge, the station clock showed 	2:37 P.M.		Paths of Glory	Jeffrey Archer
14:37	<br/>The conduit was roughly a meter and a half in diameter and pitch dark. He had expected that and had extracted a waterproof flashlight from an emergency kit in the wreckage of the Hind. It was helping, but not all that much. With the heat exchangers off, no water was flowing. The stone walls were merely moist, the curved sides covered with slime.	2:37 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover
14:38	<br/>"Abdoullah" had finished unpacking the second crate, and now he examined what he had: two fifteen-kiloton nuclear devices, made using enriched uranium-235 from the Kahuta Nuclear Research Center. He smiled again to think they had been smuggled out right from under the noses of the officials at Kahuta, directly up the security elevators leading down to the U235 centrifuge at Level Five.	2:38 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover
14:38	The bus continued on its way into Bristol, a journey he would normally cover in about twelve minutes in the Lagonda, but today it took over an hour before they finally pulled into the bus station. Hugo was neither the first nor the last passenger to get off. He checked his watch: 	2:38 p.m.	 He’d left himself enough time.	The Sins of the Father	Jeffrey Archer
14:39	Noo, there's a report come in fra' the station-master at Pinwherry that there was a gentleman tuk the 	2.39	 at Pinwherry.	Five Red Herrings	Dorothy L. Sayers
14:40	“I’ve already explained to the fellow that the only 	two-forty	 I know is the bus that runs between Golders Green and Edgware, and if I don’t get a move on, I’ll miss my beloved 14,” said Lawrence, checking his watch.	A Matter of Honor	Jeffrey Archer
14:40	If a girl looks swell when she meets you, who gives a damn if she’s late? Nobody. “We better hurry,” I said. “The show starts at 	two-forty	.”	Catcher in the Rye	J.D. Salinger
14:40	Members of Big Side marked Michael and Alan as the two most promising three-quarters for Middle Side next year, and when the bell sounded at 	twenty minutes to three	, the members of Big Side would walk with Michael and Alan towards the changing room and encourage them by flattery and genial ragging.	Sinister Street	Compton Mackenzie
14:41	. “No need to rush,” she told Emma when there was a knock on the door. She was sure she’d hung the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob and told the chauffeur not to expect them before three.	Nineteen minutes to three		Only Time Will Tell	Jeffrey Archer
14:41	At 	2.41	, when the afternoon fast train to London was pulling out of Larborough prompt to the minute, Miss Pym sat under the cedar on the lawn wondering whether she was a fool, and not caring much anyhow.	Miss Pym Disposes	Josephine Tey
14:42	It was 	two-forty-two	. Clarissa has asked to be called at two-forty-five but a few minutes could hardly matter. She knocked, quietly at first, and then more loudly. There was no reply.	The Skull Beneath the Skin	P.D. James
14:42	At 	14:42	 precisely I saw a plasm tether descend from the sky and pause outside the apartment as if it contained a sensorium that was doing some surveilling of its own.	City on Fire	Walter Jon Williams
14:42	<br/>"No!" Cally screamed, but it was already too late. Before Chris Schneider even saw it coming, Ramirez shot him precisely between the eyes, neatly and without fanfare.	2:42 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover
14:43	The 	14.43	 pulled into Tunbridge Wells on time, and William was the first person off the train. He joined the little posse awaiting him.	Over My Dead Body	Jeffrey Archer
14:43	Right! Let's get on with it. You know what we want, a full account of where you were, what you were doing, and whom you saw between one o'clock when lunch was over and 	two-forty-three	 when Miss Gray found the body.	The Skull Beneath the Skin	P.D. James
14:43	<br/>Vance watched the control room freeze as the body slumped to the floor, and he felt his fingers involuntarily bunch into a fist. The bastards were killing hostages already. They definitely were terrorists, right out of the textbook. Kill one, and frighten a thousand. Except they might not stop with one. He foresaw a long day. And night.	2:43 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover
14:43	Jacobson died at 	2.43 pm	 the next day after slashing his wrists with a razor blade in the second cubicle from the left in the men's washroom on the third floor.	Now: Zero	J.G. Ballard
14:43	Then he began to breathe more freely; “the girl,” as he always mentally dubbed her, could not enter the grounds now without his seeing her. He looked at his watch for the third time—	seventeen minutes to three	. Just about the time he had planned. She should be here soon if she had left Miss Lloyd’s a little after two.	Silverthorns	Mary Louisa Molesworth
14:44	A carriage clock in a window two up from the milliner's was showing 	sixteen minutes to three	 when I turned round and saw Bruno no more than fifty yards from me.	Friends in High Places	Caro Peacock
14:45	David arrived at 	2:45 P.M.	 at the Copley Hotel on Huntingdon Avenue, the adrenaline pumping through his body. He repeated the Harvard Business School motto to himself as he was ushered into a small private room: look British, think Yiddish.	Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less	Jeffrey Archer
14:45	He glanced down at his watch. He had been smiling as he stroked her awake, and was smiling now. “	Quarter to three	. I sat in my stupid old motel room for almost two hours after we talked, trying to convince myself that what I was thinking couldn’t be true. Only I didn’t get where I am by dodging the truth.”	Full Dark, No Stars	Stephen King
14:45	The young tinker girl knocked at the back door at 	quarter to three in the afternoon	. Marjan recognized her as one of the many freckled faces that lingered at the café windows long after other curious schoolchildren had left their mucky handprints behind.	Pomegranate Soup	Marsha Mehran
14:45	He never came down till a 	quarter to three	.	The Diary of a Nobody	George and Weedon Grossmith
14:45	Pull the other one, and tell it to the marines, and don't make me laugh, and fuck off out of it, and all that, but the fact remained that it was still only 	two forty-five	.	The Pregnant Window	Martin Amis
14:45	What time is it?<br/>"Look for yourself," the old woman says to me. I look, and I see the clock has no hands.<br/> "There are no hands," I say.<br/>The old woman looks at the clock face and says to me, "It's a 	quarter to three	."	The Old Woman	Daniil Ivanovich Kharms
14:46	The irony had come about unconsciously. Michael had roamed the Palatine that morning, selecting the site for the very advantage that now could be used against him. He looked at his watch: 	fourteen minutes to three	.	The Parsifal Mosaic	Robert Ludlum
14:47	The walls here were painted yellow, not red as they had been on Level I. The people wore yellow uniforms. A nurse by the elevator said, "The time is 	2:47 p.m.	, gentlemen. You may continue your descent in one hour."	The Andromeda Strain	Michael Crichton
14:48	<br/>Rais had finished retrieving the box of krytrons from the cockpit of the Huey and was headed down the elevator for the area directly below and south of the launch facility, the clean room where SatCom's expensive communications satellites were going to be prepped for launch.	2:48 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover
14:49	Endicott stared back at him and thought. Five thousand dollars up front and five thousand after to create a major shunt on Interstate 50 at mile marker 107, shunt to occur at 	14:49 hours	.	The Homecoming	Carsten Stroud
14:50	At 	2:50	 he called for them all to join him in the Members’ Enclosure to look at his famous filly. Stephen, like the others, trailed behind him in a little pseudo-royal entourage.	Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less	Jeffrey Archer
14:50	When it was 	2:50	 and the bank, too, had not been attacked, it was clear this was not the day of the big coup.	The Locked Room	Maj Sjöwall & Per Wahlöö
14:50	Stands the Church clock at 	ten to three	? And is there honey still for tea?	The Old Vicarage, Grantchester	Rupert Brooke
14:51	At 	nine minutes to three	, the storm came back. It rolled in on angry, brooding tiers: swollen blue-black cumulus and ghostly, low-slung nimbostratus, crowding the ceiling of the sky. It made the oxygen in the air itself compress, turn chill and thick, absorbed or displaced by the moisture that blackened and bloated the heavens.	The Bridge	John Skipp and Craig Spector
14:52	Mr. Kesselbach, it is 	eight minutes to three	. If you don't answer within eight minutes from now, you are a dead man!	813	Maurice LeBlanc
14:53	At 	2:53	 they were ushered into an empty conference room. Scott selected a chair against the wall, just behind where Warren Christopher would be seated but slightly to his left so he would have a clear view of Prime Minister Rabin across the table.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer
14:53	“And what do you suppose Father Mahoney is thinking now, sitting there like some Romanian beggar and just before teatime? He knows very well we’re expecting him.

14:54	grand ducal troikas with clinking harnesses studded with metal plaques and flying tassels, the outer horses coquetting, as usual, beside the staid trot of the shaft-horse,--all mingle in the endless procession which flows on up the Nevsky Prospekt through the Bolshaya Morskaya,--Great Sea Street,--and out upon the Neva quays, and back again, to see and be seen, until long after the sun has set on the short days, at 	six minutes to three	.	Russian Rambles	Isabel F. Hapgood
14:54	In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn’t cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in 	about 2.55	, when you know you’ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o’clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.	Life, the Universe and Everything	Douglas Adams
14:55	At 	two fifty-five	, ten men and two women, all of whom were dressed in what looked to Daphne like long black dressing gowns with purple scarves hanging from their necks, proceeded across the stage in a gentle crocodile before taking their allocated places.	As the Crow Flies	Jeffrey Archer
14:55	At 	five minutes to three	 Paolo and his best man entered the chapel and walked slowly down the aisle. Gian Lorenzo knew he’d been a well-known footballer, but he still couldn’t remember his name.	Cat O' Nine Tales	Jeffrey Archer
14:55	The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. 	Five to three	. Just nice time to walk to Artane.	Ulysses	James Joyce
14:55	At 	2.55 that afternoon	, she parked across the road from her daughter’s school and waited for the students to emerge. She hadn’t slept at all. Her eyes ached, and there was a fuzzy heat in her head.	Kill Your Brother	Jack Heath
14:56	 Helen is alone now. Her face is out of frame, and through the viewfinder I see only a segment of the pillow, an area of crumpled sheet and the upper section of her chest and shoulders.	2.56 P.M.		The 60 Minute Zoom	J.G. Ballard
14:57	He left the house at 	three minutes to three	, carrying his cloak over his arm. It was a hot day at the beginning of June, and when he stepped out at the door the air of the street smote his face like a blast from an open furnace. He reeled and almost fell.	The Manxman	Sir Hall Caine
14:58	It was 	two minutes to three	 and Blackie was sitting alone at her desk. She was oppressed by a listlessness which was partly the result of delayed shock, partly fear, but which made any action seem an intolerable exertion. She supposed she could go home, although no one had told her so.	Original Sin	P.D. James
14:58	But generally it’s the other way, the slow way. She’ll turn that dial to a dead stop and freeze the sun there on the screen so it don’t move a scant hair for weeks, so not a leaf on a tree or a blade of grass in the pasture shimmers. The clock hands hang at 	two minutes to three	 and she’s liable to let them hang there till we rust.	One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest	Ken Kesey
14:58	From twenty minutes past nine until twenty-seven minutes past nine, from twenty-five minutes past eleven until twenty-eight minutes past eleven, from ten minutes to three until 	two minutes to three	 the heroes of the school met in a large familiarity whose Olympian laughter awed the fearful small boy that flitted uneasily past and chilled the slouching senior that rashly paused to examine the notices in assertion of an unearned right.	Sinister Street	Compton Mackenzie
14:58	We betted that it would happen on the morrow; they took us up and gave us the odds of two to one; we betted that it would happen in the afternoon; we got odds of four to one on that; we betted that it would happen at 	two minutes to three	; they willingly granted us the odds of ten to one on that.	The Chronicle of Young Satan	Mark Twain
14:59	At 	one minute to three	, five senior staffers entered the room, and Scott was pleased to see that Susan Anderson was among them.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer

15:00	Gunther's two conflicting feelings about Christmas almost rubbed each other out on the First Sunday in Advent. By 	three o'clock	 the fear feeling had practically vanished.	Bright Valley of Love	Edna Hong

15:00	The little velociraptor opened her jaws and hissed at Grant, in a posture of sudden intense fury.<br>“Fascinating,” Grant said.<br>“Can I stay and play with her?” Tim said.<br>“Not right now,” Ed Regis said, glancing at his watch. “	It’s three o’clock	, and it’s a good time for a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for them.”	Jurassic Park	Michael Crichton

15:00	A few moments later, about 	three o’clock	, Courfeyrec chanced to be passing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had redoubled in violence, and filled the air.	Les Misérables	Victor Hugo
15:00	At 	three o’clock on the afternoon	 there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.	The Sign of Four	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
15:00	“Then good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at 	three o’clock	 I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”	The Sign of Four	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
15:00	The next afternoon at 	three	, I went to meet the new teacher. When I stepped inside Julian’s office I was shocked. It was completely empty. The books, the rugs, the big round table were all gone.	The Secret History	Donna Tartt
15:00	At about 	three o’clock in the afternoon	, my whole body is hit by an overwhelming tiredness and I spent the last couple of hours of the day perusing the gift shop for stuffed koalas for Kay and Olivia and chilling out at a table inside the air-conditioned café.	Pictures of Lily	Paige Toon
15:00	All the doors were locked, everything in its proper place. Nothing out of the ordinary. I went back to the janitor’s room, set my alarm for 	three	, and fell fast asleep.	Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami
15:00	When the alarm went off at 	three	, though, I woke up feeling weird. I can’t explain it, but I just felt different. I didn’t feel like getting up—it was like something was suppressing my will to get out of bed. I’m the type who usually leaps right out of bed, so I couldn’t understand it.	Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami
15:00	Luisa crosses the office to Dom Grelsch’s door. Her boss is speaking on the phone in a low, irate voice. Luisa waits outside but overhears. “No—no, no, Mr, Frum, it 𝘪𝘴 black-and-white, tell me—hey, 𝘐’𝘮 talking now—tell me a 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 black-and-white ‘condition’ than leukemia? Know what I think? I think my wife is just one piece of paperwork between you and your 	three o’clock	 golf slot, isn’t she?”	Cloud Atlas	David Mitchell
15:00	Jarvis whistled through his teeth. “Will the law help a man of your years bounce back from multiple spinal fractures, Timothy?”<br>Eddie: “Men of your age don’t bounce. They splat.”<br>I fought with all my might, but my sphincter was no longer my own and a cannonade fired off. Amusement or condescension I could have borne, but my tormentors’ pity signified my abject defeat. The toilet chain was pulled.<br>“	Three o’clock	,” Cavendish-Redux went down the pan.	Cloud Atlas	David Mitchell
15:00	I had pushed too hard. “Damn it to hell, Tim, my bank 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘦𝘥! We were bled dry by those bloodsuckers at Lloyds! The days when I had that kind of spondulics at my beck and call are gone, gone, gone! Out house is mortgaged, twice over! I’m the mighty fallen, you’re the miniscule fallen. Anyway, you’ve got this ruddy book flying out of every bookshop in the known world!”<br>My face said what I had no words for.<br>“Oh Christ, you idiot. What’s the repayment schedule?”<br>I looked at my watch. “	Three o’clock	 this afternoon.”	Cloud Atlas	David Mitchell
15:00	By 	three o’clock	, the heat had morphed into a feral creature, a snake bent on prey. It hissed and slithered across the pavements, poked its flaming tongue through keyholes. People inched closer t their fans, sucked harder on ice cubes and opened the windows, only to close them instantly.	The Island of Missing Trees	Elif Shafak
15:00	When the clock struck 	three	, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.	Pride and Prejudice	Jane Austen
15:00	I sat down on the woodpile we kept under a swatch of canvas on this side of the house. “I imagine you’re out here on business. My wife’s.”<br>“I am.”<br>“Well, you’ve had your drink, so we better get down to it.

15:00	And now it was 	three o’clock	. The Antichrist had been on Earth for fifteen hours, and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them.	Good Omens	Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman
15:00	The city clocks had only just gone 	three	, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.	A Christmas Carol	Charles Dickens
15:00	Dating from 	three o’clock	 yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.	Emma	Jane Austen
15:00	Amory saw girls doing things that even in his memory would have been impossible: eating 	three-o’clock	, after-dance suppers in impossible cafes, talking of every side of life with an air half of earnestness, half of mockery, yet with a furtive excitement that Amory considered stood for a real moral let-down. But he never realized how wide-spread it was until he saw the cities between New York and Chicago as one vast juvenile intrigue.	This Side of Paradise	F. Scott Fitzgerald
15:00	The afternoon waned from the purging good of 	three o’clock	 to the golden beauty of four.	This Side of Paradise	F. Scott Fitzgerald
15:00	With some difficulty, James battled his way past waves of scent, screeching voices and glossy black hair. <br>“What on earth is going on?” he asked when he reached the safety of his office.<br>Carlo shrugged. “It’s 	three o’clock	.”<br>“I’m aware of the time, Carlo. Why are there so many women outside?”<br>“They are the 𝘧𝘪𝘥𝘢𝘯𝘻𝘢𝘵𝘦. The women who want to marry Allied servicemen.”	The Wedding Officer	Anthony Capella

15:00	#REF!	Three		Mrs. Dalloway	Virginia Woolf
15:00	At 	three o'clock	 on the afternoon of that same day, he called on her. She held out her two hands, smiling in her usual charming, friendly way; and for a few seconds they looked deep into each other's eyes.	Bel-Ami	Guy de Maupassant
15:00	At 	three	 on the Wednesday afternoon, that bit of the painting was completed.	The Moonstone	Wilkie Collins
15:00	Ditched by the woman I loved, I exalted my suffering into a sign of greatness (lying collapsed on a bed at 	three	 in the afternoon), and hence protected myself from experiencing my grief as the outcome of what was at best a mundane romantic break-up. Chloe's departure may have killed me, but it had at least left me in glorious possession of the moral high ground. I was a martyr.	Essays in Love	Alain de Botton
15:00	He walks into the Hospital for Broken Things at 	three o'clock	 on Monday afternoon. That was the arrangement. If he came in after six o'clock, he was to head straight for the house in Sunset Park.	Sunset Park	Paul Auster
15:00	I had a 	three o’clock	 class in psychology, the first meeting of the semester, and I suspected I was going to miss it. I was right.

Achates McNeil	T.C. Boyle
15:00	It was 	three o'clock	 in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr. Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk, the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in their walks	Middlemarch	George Eliot
15:00	Ladies bathed before noon, after their 	three-o’clock	 naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.	To Kill a Mockingbird	Harper Lee

15:00	 is the perfect time in Cham, because anything is possible. You can still ski, but also respectably start drinking, the shops have just reopened, the sun is still up. 	Three o'clock	 is never too late or too early.	Cham	Jonathan Trigell
15:00	Today was the day Alex had appointed for her 'punishment'. I became increasingly nervous as the hour of 	three o'clock	 approached. I was alone in the house, and paced restlessly from room to room, glancing at the clocks in each of them.	Deaf Sentence	David Lodge
15:01	The sun was now setting. It was 	about three	 in the afternoon when Alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were; so she had made pretty good progress with it - for her.

15:01	There'll be twenty pallets' worth by three o'clock tomorrow, see, comes a man's voice from the office down the hall, "and if your truck isn't here at 	one minute past three	, then the lot'll be going to the Fine Fare depot in Aylesford."	The Bone Clocks	David Mitchell
15:01	It was 	one minute past three	. As he walked, he became aware of the echoing sound his feet made on the marble floor. It was then that he heard a voice say, “Do you wish to confess, my son?”	Sons of Fortune	Jeffrey Archer

15:10	At 	3:10 p.m.	, the restaurant was still about two hours from opening, which was how Randy liked it for their visits.

I’ll pay in cash.”<br>“Not a 𝘱𝘳𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘳, sir.” The clerk’s tiredness shows through her makeup. “Earliest I can manage”—she consults a teleprinted sheet—"London Heathrow . . .. tomorrow afternoon, 	three-fifteen	 departure, Laker Skytrains, change at JFK."

He had been on the point of slipping Edgar Wallace into his pocket. The clock over the Prince of Wales struck a 	quarter past three	.	Keep the Aspidistra Flying	George Orwell
15:15	I got out my old clothes. I put wool socks over my regular socks and took my time lacing up the boots. I made a couple of tuna sandwiches and some double-decker peanut-butter crackers. I filled my canteen and attached the hunting knife and the canteen to my belt. As I was going out the door, I decided to leave a note. So I wrote: "Feeling better and going to Birch Creek. Back soon.

Doctor Sleep	Stephen King
15:20	When the phone rang at 	three twenty	 I was sprawled out on the tatami, starting at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December 1971 spotlight.	Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami

16:39	Harlem enjoys lazy Sabbath mornings, although the pace picks up again in the afternoon, after church. My watch read 	4:39 p.m.	, and I realized that I hadn't eaten all day.

16:40	Kaufman placed his hands together as if in prayer, and when his prayer was answered, he said, “I’ll need to make a few phone calls before I come to a final decision, so come back to my office at 	4:40	 tomorrow afternoon.

16:40	 P.M. Besta sang another hymn. Everyone knew something was wrong. How long did they wait? The mayor was going crazy inside, as was the mayor's wife, as was their daughter. Seiji could barely contain his rage. He was turning as red as his red tuxedo.	Four forty		Trouble & Triumph: A Novel of Power & Beauty	Tip "T.I." Harris with David Ritz

16:41	It was 	just after 4:40	 on Wednesday afternoon. At the back of the newsroom was Graham's office, up several steps from the bullpen area that ran from the front door back to the office.

16:42	I'm always happy when I reach the finish line of a long-distance race, but this time it really struck me hard. I pumped my right fist into the air. The time was 4:42 pm.

16:46	At 	4:46	 an obese, middle-aged man shuffled in. Wearing a starched guayabera and dark green pants, Ureña asked for a book on confectionery, then took a seat at the end of the same reading room. Evelina and Leticia exchanged astonished glances. It definitely was one of those days.	The Havana World Series	José Latour
16:47	But maybe it was more than that, maybe Affenlight had erred badly somehow, because here it was 4:49 by his watch, 	4:47	 by the wall clock, and Owen had not yet come.	The Art of Fielding	Chad Harbach
16:48	By 	four forty-eight	 the five-man team had her back again and the urgent struggle to save Ellen's life continued. She'd now been undergoing surgery for the best part of two hours, and it was doubtful her body could sustain much more trauma.	Taking Chances	Susan Lewis

16:57	After an hour, they caught one gold-and-brown-striped fish that was kind of small, and they put him back. Prager swore it was a baby walleye; Eva seemed fairly sure it wasn’t. <br>After another hour of drowning worms and losing them in little nibbles, it was 	almost 5:00 p.m.	, and supposedly the best time to catch walleye was in the evening; clearly, they were just too eager and had started too early.

16:58	At a quarter to three Carol had left home; at half-past four she had created the Georgian town; at a quarter to five she was in the dignified poverty of the Congregational parsonage, her enthusiasm pattering upon Mrs. Leonard Warren like summer rain upon an old gray roof; at 	two minutes to five	 a town of demure courtyards and welcoming dormer windows had been erected, and at two minutes past five the entire town was as flat as Babylon.

17:00	The gloomy 	five o'clock	 sky was such as you might see on any autumn afternoon. The few houses and the clumps of red or yellowish trees were in no way remarkable. Who could imagine that a little farther on in the quiet landscape I should meet and shake by the hand a man who had lived and eaten and drunk in a world forty million miles distant from London, who had seen this earth from where it looks like a mere point of green fire, and who had spoken with a creature whose life began before our own planet was inhabitable?

17:00	“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.<br>“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.

17:00	Mark was reluctant to go to work, but I said not to worry, I’d be fine. I’d have to be fine eventually and I might as well start now. He said he’d skip out directly after school, get someone else to cover Homework Club; he’d by home by 	five	. It was my day off, which struck me as a bit of a waste, but at least I didn’t have to call Sinead and explain why I wasn’t coming in.	The Body Lies	Jo Baker
17:00	That evening found him sitting at the mouth of a large storm drain on the slope beneath the Cape Fear Memorial Bridge. He had a room, but there was the small matter of stacked-up back rent, which he had absolutely promised to pay as of 	5 p.m.	 yesterday. Nor was that all. If he returned to his room, he might be invited to visit a certain fortresslike municipal building on Bess Street, to answer certain questions about a certain bar altercation. On the whole, it seemed safer to stay away.	Doctor Sleep	Stephen King
17:00	My shadow would walk with my on the sand, at least twenty feet long. Hopeful gulls, smelling the croissants in their waxed paper, would circle overhead.

Joyland	Stephen King
17:00	Work started as usual on her twentieth birthday, November 17. It had been raining on and off that afternoon, and pouring since early evening.

17:00	“But how did it end?” I interrupt.<br>“That’s just it . . . it didn’t end. I promised to see her Tuesday around 	five o’clock	. That’s bad, you know! There were lines in her face which will look much worse in daylight. I suppose she wants me to f*** her Tuesday.”	Tropic of Cancer	Henry Miller
17:00	With Tania back on the scene, a steady job, the drunken talk about Russia, the walks home at night, and Paris in full summer, life seems to lift its head a little higher. That’s why perhaps, a letter such as Boris sent me seems absolutely cockeyed. Most every day I meet with Tania around 	five o’clock	, to have a Porto with her, as she calls it. I let her take me to places I’ve never seen before, the swell bars around the Champs-Élysées where the sound of jazz and baby voices crooning seems to soak right through the mahogany woodwork.	Tropic of Cancer	Henry Miller
17:00	On earth, the clock commanded our lives. I was always aware of the time, and the day of the week, and the month and year. I had made so many plans, mostly with James. "See you at my house at 	five	", I would write him, or "Meet me in the garden tomorrow after school."	Kaleidoscope	Brian Selznick
17:00	Next day at 	five o’clock	 she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.	The Great Gatsby	F. Scott Fitzgerald
17:00	The house was in darkness. I didn’t know what to expect when I pushed open the front door. Ben would be missing me; he had said he would be home by 	five	. I pictured him pacing up and down the living room	Before I Go to Sleep	S.J. Watson
17:00	“As part of our effort to discourage drinking and driving, our policy is to courtesy-call people who leave their cars in our lot after closing,” Betsy Neal said. “Your Ford Expedition, Connecticut license plate 775 NSD, will be available for pickup until 	five PM	 this evening.”	Full Dark, No Stars	Stephen King
17:00	On this one, the dark background looked like the intersection of Market and Powell at 	5:00 P.M.	, a virtual traffic jam of compressed, energetic spheres. Speedy messengers, all carrying oxygen to parts of someone else’s body.	1st to Die	James Patterson
17:00	On the principle that the best hiding place is in plain sight, the core group of conspirators met at 	five o’clock	 that afternoon in Kordt’s office in the Prussian State building: Gisevius and von Schulenburg from the Interior Ministry, Dohnányi from Justice, Colonel Oster of the Abwehr, and Kordt and Hartmann from the Foreign Service.	Munich	Robert Harris
17:00	At 	five o’clock	 the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	Pride and Prejudice	Jane Austen

17:00	At 	five o’clock	 he felt the need of hearing his own voice, so he retreated to his house to see if any one else had arrived. Having climbed the rickety stairs he scrutinized his room resignedly, concluding that it was hopeless to attempt any more inspired decoration than class banners and tiger pictures. There was a tap at the door.	This Side of Paradise	F. Scott Fitzgerald
17:00	About three-fourths of the whole business was for effect and therefore harmless, ended at the door of the cafe, soon enough for the 	five-o’clock	 train back to Yale or Princeton; about one-fourth continued on into the dimmer hours and gathered strange dust from strange places. Their party was scheduled to be one of the harmless kind.	This Side of Paradise	F. Scott Fitzgerald
17:00	At 	five o’clock	 I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters.	The Sun Also Rises	Ernest Hemingway
17:00	 Read a book	5.00 p.m.		The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Mark Haddon
17:00	At 	five o'clock	 that afternoon, while Barbara waited in a taxi, Harold went into the convent in Auteuil and explained to the nun who sat in the concierge's glass cage that Mme. Straus-Muguet was expecting them. He assumed that men were not permitted any further, and that they would all three go out for tea.	The Chateau	William Maxwell
17:00	At 	five o’clock	 adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean.	The Horror at Red Hook	H.P. Lovecraft
17:00	But I took the mixture at 	five o'clock	 in the afternoon. I run my tongue over my dry mouth. I feel dizzy. I know this dizziness: it's because I haven't had a cigarette for hours.	The End of Mr. Y	Scarlett Thomas
17:00	ERE THE HALF-HOUR ended, 	five o'clock	 struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend; it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor.	Jane Eyre	Charlotte Brontë
17:00	From 	five o'clock	 to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure.	The Portrait of a Lady	Henry James
17:00	He found it harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at 	five o'clock	, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.	Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone	J.K. Rowling
17:00	She had not seen her yet, as Osmond had given her to understand that it was too soon to begin. She drove at 	five o'clock	 to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of the Piazza Navona, and was admitted by the portress of the convent, a genial and obsequious person. Isabel had been at this institution before; she had come with Pansy to see the sisters.	The Portrait of a Lady	Henry James
17:00	Until 	five o'clock	 there was no sign of life from the room. Then he rang for his servant and ordered a cold bath.	Embers	Sandor Marai
17:00	We motored, I remember, leaving London in the morning in a heavy shower of rain, coming to Manderley about 	five o'clock	, in time for tea. I can see myself now, unsuitably dressed as usual, although a bride of seven weeks, in a tan-coloured stockinette frock, a small fur known as a stone marten round my neck, and over all a shapeless mackintosh, far too big for me and dragging to my ankles.	Rebecca	Daphne du Maurier
17:00	I haven't been to church in over a year.<br/>"Finally worried about your soul?"<br/>"Please," Cork said<br/>"Of course we can talk. When?"<br/>"Tomorrow. Late afternoon maybe. Say 	five o'clock	?"<br/>"Make it six," the priest suggested. "My office."<br/>"I'll be there," Cork promised.	Iron Lake	William Kent Krueger

17:02	She stood up, shook her hair into place, smoothed her skirt and turned on the light. It was 	two minutes past five	. She would have thought it midnight or five in the morning.	Duplicate Keys	Jane Smiley
17:03	Good evening, Mrs. Scheindlin, the man said before departing.<br/>"Good evening, Chris. Say hello to the wife for me."<br/>"I sure will. Thanks. Bye," he said, waving to Elliot, who returned the goodbye. It was 	5:03	 when Elliot rested the handset in its cradle.	Comrades in Miami: A Novel	José Latour
17:03	I looked down at the watch Trey had given me last Christmas, the delicate gold links so real and solid, and it seemed like someone else’s memory strapped to someone else’s shaking hand. It was 	5:03	 now. I was halfway to my house.	Mother May I	Joshilyn Jackson

17:07	, the Abbot, a young Manchester terrier, began chirruping. He stood on the body of his owner, Flora, with his forepaws on the sill of the balcony, stared through the green rattan blinds, and trembled. He could see the farmer in the field, and Edward asleep on the next balcony.	About five		The People With the Dogs	Christina Stead

17:10	The earpiece crackled and he scrawled down the numbers. Cut the switchboard off and dialed Holly’s pager. Just got a long low tone telling him the pager was switched off. Then he tried the cell phone number. He got an electronic bleep and a recorded message of a woman telling him the phone he was dialing was unreachable. He hung up and looked around the room. It was 	ten after five	, Monday afternoon.	Die Trying	Lee Child
17:10	 A ground-to-ground cruise missile, launched from a tractor installed in the backyard of Leonard Sudavico's former home by Rashan and a crew of technicians from Afghanistan, exploded onto the Paul Clay estate in the exact spot where the life-size mermaid had once swum in the waterfall.

17:10	Hours later, at 	ten minutes past five	, Saturday afternoon, Nora and Travis and Jim Keene crowded in front of the mattress on which Einstein lay.

17:15	It was only a 	quarter past five	, but the evening was as dark as midnight. And when he reached the edge of the porch the rain began falling.	A Taste for Death	P.D. James
17:15	It was about 	5:15	 when Grant noticed a new face entering the room. He was a priest roughly Grant's age. The medium-built man looked a bit disheveled.	Warrior Monk	Ray Keating
17:15	<br>Yep, Jack Cermak’s Corner Tap was the eighth circle of hell. In a gentrifying neighborhood like Logan Square, setting up a sanitized, overpriced bar to look like a cheap small-town dive was just plain sick.	5:15 P.M.		Kitchens of the Great Midwest	J. Ryan Stradal
17:15	When August Bach emerged from the gloomy chill of the air-conditioned Divisional Fighter Control bunker it was 	17:15 hrs	 CET. The day had ripened into one of those mellow summer afternoons when the air is warm and sweet like soft toffee	Bomber	Len Deighton
17:16	I think the first one I remember happening was on the London Underground, Circle line, 	17.16 p.m.	<br/>She went on to describe what had happened or not quite happened.	Money Never Sleeps	Stella Whitelaw
17:17	And it was just 	seventeen minutes past five	 when Dick French, hanging in a frenzy of anxiety over the paddock fence circling the inside of the mile oval, uttered something resembling a howl and rushed to the gate to signal his recreant driver.	The Flying Mercury	Eleanor M. Ingram
17:18	Lupin rose, without breaking his contemptuous silence, and took the sheet of paper. I remembered soon after that, at this moment, I happened to look at the clock. It was 	eighteen minutes past five	.	The Confessions of Arsène Lupin	Maurice LeBlanc
17:18	Thursday 	5:18 P.M.	<br/>Yuri Andreevich was mad as hell. After his one-on-one with Tanzan Mino, he knew he'd been screwed. Sticking a couple of "pilots" from Mino Industries in the cockpit. It was just the old GRU trick, surveillance under the specious guise of "support." He'd seen it all before.	Project Daedalus	Thomas Hoover
17:19	Scott eased himself into the corner before once again checking the little sulphur dots on his watch. It was 	5:19	. He and Hannah had been in the safe for an hour and seventeen minutes.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer
17:19	The call came at 	5.19 p.m.	 The line was surprisingly clear. A man introduced himself as Major Liepa from the Riga police. Wallander made notes as he listened, occasionally answering a question.	The Dogs of Riga	Henning Mankell
17:20	I'm going to park here and walk in. I don't want to drive into a zoo. He glanced at his watch. "It's only 	five-twenty	. Kidnapper's call is supposed to come at six. We've got time."	Purgatory Ridge	William Kent Krueger
17:20	If she can keep her speed to seventy until she leaves the turnpike at midtown, and if she catches most of the traffic lights, she estimates she can be at her building by 	five-twenty	.	If It Bleeds	Stephen King
17:20	The Meeting was listed as starting at 1730, and it was only around 	1720	, and Hal thought the voices might signify some sort of pre-Meeting orientation for people who've come for the first time, sort of tentatively, just to scout the whole enterprise out, so he doesn't knock.	Infinite Jest	David Foster Wallace
17:21	He next proceeded to examine seriatim the dead man's pockets, turning each of them inside out and taking the contents, where they appeared adapted to his needs: for instance, a silken purse, through the interstices of which some gold was visible; a watch, which however had been injured by the explosion, and had stopt just at the moment - 	twenty-one minutes past five	 - when the catastrophe took place.	The Ancestral Footstep	Nathaniel Hawthorne
17:22	I expect she didn't want Octavia to know that she'd called in her father, not until they'd worked out a plan. And I was the one who fixed the time. I didn't see how I could catch a train before the 	seventeen-twenty-two	 which gets in to Waterloo at nineteen-twenty-nine.	A Certain Justice	P.D. James
17:23	I was wondering if we could meet for a drink.<br/>"What for?"<br/>"Just for a chat. Do you know the Royal batsman, near Central Station? We could meet tomorrow at five?"<br/>"	Five twenty-three	," I said, to exert some control over the situation.	A Fraction of the Whole	Steve Toltz
17:24	At Baltimore, it was said, twelve hours after the passage of the sun of the meridian of Kilimanjaro, it was 	5:24 P.M.	 It is impossible to describe the pangs which were produced at this moment. The most powerful of modern pens would be helpless at the task. The people of Baltimore stood fearing that they would be swept off the surface of the earth by the terrible mass of water which would fall on their city.	Topsy-Turvy	Jules Verne
17:25	By 	5:25	 neither of them was at his side and his famous “cool” was beginning to show distinct signs of steaming.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer
17:25	I left Weymouth Street at about 	five twenty-five	, but I expect the dental nurse and the receptionist will be able to confirm the time. I found that my motorcycle had been taken.	The Murder Room	P.D. James
17:25	It was 	five-twenty-five	 when I pulled up in front of the library. Still early for our date, so I got out of the car and took a stroll down the misty streets. In a coffee shop, watched a golf match on television, then I went to an entertainment center and played a video game. The object of the game was to wipe out tanks invading from across the river. I was winning at first, but as the game went on, the enemy tanks bred like lemmings, crushing me by sheer number and destroying my base. An on-screen nuclear blast took care of everything, followed by the message game over insert coin.	Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World	Haruki Murakami
17:25	Now, said Handsley, when Angela had poured out the last cup, "it's 	twenty-five minutes past five	, at half-past the Murder game is on."	A Man Lay Dead	Ngaio Marsh
17:26	There's a train that leaves Totnes at 	twenty-six minutes past five	 this afternoon, I said, "and it reaches London at-"	Wildtrack	Bernard Cornwell

17:27	Thursday 	5:27 P.M.	<br/>"Strasvetye," came a voice behind Eva. "Kak pazhavatye."<br/>She whirled around. Moving in fast was a tall and — admit it — not bad-looking Soviet major.	Project Daedalus	Thomas Hoover
17:28	And so, when he told her on May 15 at 	5:28	 in the afternoon that he had to be moving on, she passed out. She was in his bed at the time.	Smart Women	Judy Blume
17:29	Well? he said. <br/> "It's 	twenty-nine minutes past five	, Insert Name Here," said the imp nervously.	Thud!	Terry Pratchett
17:30	He picks her up, places her on the bed, lies down beside her. He kisses her again, tentatively, lingeringly. Then he asks what time it is. He himself has no watch. Lesje tells him it’s 	five-thirty	. He sits up. Lesje is beginning to feel slightly unattractive. Are her teeth too large, is that it?	Life Before Man	Margaret Atwood
17:30	It was 	half-past five	 before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits, a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.	The Sign of Four	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
17:30	How could anyone say no to Erin Cook? <br>Well, God said no. God burned Tom Kennedy’s lot, and He burned hers in the process. When I picked up the phone at 	five-thirty	 on a gorgeous October afternoon in Westchester, that girl had become a woman whose voice, blurry with the tears, sounded old and tired to death.	Joyland	Stephen King
17:30	Finally, around 	5:30	, Eva’s red-and-white bobber plunked below the water, and her thin green rod bowed with an invigorating weight. It was another one of the gold-and-brown guys, beautiful and gasping, held aloft by his lips, urgently splattering the air.	Kitchens of the Great Midwest	J. Ryan Stradal
17:30	He went up to his coachman, who was dozing on the box in the shadow, already lengthening, of a thick lime-tree; he admired the shifting clouds of midges circling over the hot horses, and, waking the coachman, he jumped into the carriage, and told him to drive to Bryansky’s. It was only after driving nearly five miles that he had sufficiently recovered himself to look at his watch, and realise that it was 	half-past five	, and he was late.	Anna Karenina	Leo Tolstoy
17:30	October 6.— So as not to have too far to walk, I go out about four intending to stop in at the "Nouvelle France," where Nadja is supposed to meet me at 	5:30	. This gives me time to stroll around the boulevards not far from the Opéra, I have to pick up my pen from the shop where it is being repaired.	Nadja	André Breton
17:31	They discussed the transmission: which of their friends, they wondered, was responsible for it? But at 	17:31	 Pick called back	Heavy Water	Martin Amis
17:31	Tuesday 	5:31 P.M.	<br/>"It's the best I can manage, Michael." Nogami's voice was apologetic. "Nobody knows I keep this place, not even my wife."<br/>"Afternoon business conferences."<br/>"You catch my meaning." He smiled and walked on up the sandstone steps.	Project Daedalus	Thomas Hoover
17:32	It was exactly 	thirty-two minutes past five o'clock	 on the evening of Friday, December 9th, when the station-master at Anerly received the following communication by wire from the signal box at Froest Hill: 5.28 down from London Bridge just passed.	Cleek, the Master Detective	Thomas W. Hanshew
17:33	He and Lady Ursula were back at number sixty-two by 	five thirty-three	. He could remember the time exactly because he had looked at the car clock.	A Taste for Death	P.D. James
17:33	It was 	five thirty-three	 when we left. Is it six o'clock now? Six thirty? And Mark's still in his cage and I'm scared to drive very fast. . . what if we don't get there in time?	Among the Brave	Margaret Peterson Haddix
17:33	At 	5:33 p.m.	 there is a blast of two deep, resonant notes a major third apart. On another day there is the same blast at 12:54 p.m. On another, exactly 8:00 a.m.	Varieties of Disturbance	Lydia Davis
17:34	At five-thirty. I was here about 	four minutes later	. Judging by the appearance of the blood and the beginning of rigor in the side of the face, I guessed that he had been dead about five hours.	Death in Holy Orders	P.D. James
17:35	At 	5:35	, he got word over the radio that Helmunth Hanover of the Aurora Sentinel had received a call from an anonymous spokesperson for the Minnesota Civilian Brigade threatening some form of retaliation if the Indians fished.	Iron Lake	William Kent Krueger
17:36	At that moment I looked again at my watch because I wanted to be back at the Cathedral as Evensong ended at about twenty to six in order to talk to the choirmaster before he left. I saw I only had four minutes before it ended.<br/>"So that occurred at 	precisely twenty-four minutes before six	?"<br/>"Exactly."	The Unburied	Charles Palliser
17:37	Look, Lucille, said Joe when Lucille strolled into the office at 	5:37	. "I don't know what you said to this gal, but it seems to have had exactly the opposite of the desired effect. She's got some bee in her bonnet about Harvard Law School."	Lightning Rods	Helen DeWitt
17:38	And then I see something I recognise. Some little green digits, glowing in the blackness. It’s Ben’s alarm clock. Somehow I’m back here, in the apartment. I blink the numbers. 	17:38	. But that can’t be right. That’s the afternoon.	The Paris Apartment	Lucy Foley
17:38	He stares at the phone, thinks: Ring. Ring now. But it remains inert. 	5.38 p.m.	 Bunny will be done with her housekeeping shift by now.	Cloud Cuckoo Land	Anthony Doerr
17:38	It was 	5.38 p.m.	 when the Prime Minister’s plane finally broke through the clouds and appeared above Heston Aerodrome. As the ground flickered into view, Legat could see the traffic along the Great West Road. Cars were halted for more than a mile in either direction. It had been raining heavily.	Munich	Robert Harris
17:39	It’s 0	5:39	 so we can have dinner, it’s quick noodles. While they’re in the hot water, Ma finds hard words to test me from the milk carton like nutritional that means food, and pasteurized that means laser guns zapped away the germs.	Room	Emma Donoghue
17:40	As no one had “any other business” to raise, I closed the meeting at 	5:40	, and suggested to Jeremy that he join Rosemary and me for dinner. I wanted to see them together.	Trial and Error	Jeffrey Archer
17:40	What? I said, "is it 5:30 yet?"<br/>"Er, 	5:40	." Heavens, they'll be starving. But then that's a good thing. Let them.	I Love Dollars	Zhu Wen
17:40	It's 	five-forty	 now. The party's at six. By about ten past, the eleventh floor should be clearing. Arnold is a very popular partner; no one's going to miss his farewell speech if they can help it. Plus, at Carter Spink parties, the speeches always happen early on, so people can get back to work if they need to. And while everyone's listening I'll slip down to Arnold's office. It should work. It has to work. As I stare at my own bizarre reflection, I feel a grim resolve hardening inside me. He's not going to get away with everyone thinking he's a cheery, harmless old teddy bear. He's not going to get away with it.	The Undomestic Goddess	Sophie Kinsella
17:41	All right, people, let's haul ass. Sunset's at 	17:41	 and we've got twenty-three k to go. Staff Segeant Beyn got to his feet and the platoon followed.	The Heart of Valor	Tanya Huff
17:42	Well, they set sail, and after going ever so many thousand miles, or hundred - I forget which, but it doesn't matter- a great storm arose, a typhoon or simoon, perhaps both; and after slowly gathering up its energies for the space of twenty-nine days, seven hours, and twenty-three minutes, without counting the seconds, it burst upon them at exactly 	forty-two minutes past five	, on the sixth day of the week.	The Dodge Club; Or, Italy in MDCCCLIX	James De Mille
17:43	“I always prefer to travel on a British carrier,” Don Pedro told the purser as they were shown to their seats in first class. The Boeing Stratocruiser took off at 	5:43 p.m.	, just a few minutes behind schedule.	Best Kept Secret	Jeffrey Archer
17:43	It’s 	5:43	. Time is racing, racing.	If It Bleeds	Stephen King
17:44	Janice is not waiting for him in the lounge or beside the pool when at last 	around 5.45	 they come home from playing the par-5 eighteenth. Instead one of the girls in their green and white uniforms comes over and tells him that his wife wants him to call home.	Rabbit Is Rich	John Updike
17:45	“A 	quarter to six	,” answered the midwife.<br/>“And what if I really am dying?” thought Olga Mihalovna, looking at her husband’s head and the window-panes on which the rain was beating.	The Party	Anton Pavlovich Chekhov
17:45	At 	a quarter to six	, there was a rapping sound outside my door. I checked out the peephole. Ramirez stood outside, dressed in a big red basketball-type tank top, black shorts, and flip-flops.	White Night	Jim Butcher
17:46	At 	fourteen minutes to six	 they walked into the director’s study, where a young lady of Sally’s age offered the guests a choice of dry sherry or orange juice.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer
17:47	Then I take it the matter is practically concluded, said the clergyman. "And that you very properly submit to return to your proper home. And now, if I may offer a suggestion, it is that we take tea. Freed of its tannin, nothing, I think, is more refreshing and stimulating."<br/>"There's a train from Lyndhurst at 	thirteen minutes to six	," said Widgery, unfolding a time table.	The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll	H.G. Wells
17:48	Father came home at 	5:48 p.m.	 I heard him come through the front door. Then he came into the living room. He was wearing a lime green and sky blue check shirt and there was a double knot on one of his shoes but not on the other.	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Mark Haddon
17:49	, SUNDAY, JUNE 8TH, 1924 WHEN ODELL ARRIVED back at Camp IV, he was unable to conceal his excitement. He crawled into Norton’s tent and told him what he’d seen.	5:49 P.M.		Paths of Glory	Jeffrey Archer
17:49	It was 	eleven minutes to six	. After a moment he idly drew the center drawer of the desk out over his lap. For a moment he stared at the gun without recognition. Then he gave a yelp and leaped up. She had put it back!	The Comforts of Home	Flannery O'Connor
17:50	He glanced up at the clock above the door: 	ten to six	. Young Kevin would appear through that door at any moment and ask if he would be kind enough to move on.	The Grass is Always Greener	Jeffrey Archer
17:50	What time is it Jack?<br/>"	Ten to six	"<br/>"Ten more minutes then." I shuffle the cards. "Time for a quick game of rummy?"	Noughts and Crosses	Malorie Blackman
17:50	Esterville had called the truck stop, but no one had seen his wife come in. She hadn't returned home. Cork and McDougal found her red Mustang at 	5:50	.	Corpus Delicti	William Kent Krueger
17:51	She read through the first page slowly and made of a couple of emendations, aware that any mistake made hastily on a Friday evening could be regretted in the weeks to come. She glanced at the clock on her desk as she signed the final page of the document. It was just showing 	5:51	.	Never Stop on the Motorway	Jeffrey Archer
17:51	The sun was red and the shadows were long and dark. It wanted but 	nine minutes to six	, and within the hotel the disgraceful National Swill was in full flow, men pouring as much liquor down their throats as possible before the fatal hour of drought arrived.	Venom House	Arthur Upfield
17:52	It was 	eight minutes to six o'clock	. "I must get him," he told the telephone girl for the dozenth time.<br/> "Sorry- no one will answer," she said wearily.	Jimmy Kirkland and the Plot for a Pennant	Hugh S. Fullerton
17:53	That boy will be spoiled, as sure as I go on springs; he's made such a lot of.

The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch	Talbot Baines Reed
17:54	It was 	5:54 p.m.	 when Father came back into the living room. He said, "What is this?" but he said it very quietly and I didn't realise that he was angry because he wasn't shouting.	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Mark Haddon
17:55	One, two, three, four, five, six… She wound each clock in turn, three turns each, putting just enough power in the springs to get them ticking in time for Mr Westcott’s inspection. Speaking of which…it was 	five minutes to six	. Five minutes before Mr. Westcott would arrive to inspect his clocks. Helena swallowed. She could hear footsteps thundering in the room below and the occasional exclamation from Stanley.	The House of One Hundred Clocks	A.M. Howell
17:55	The wind moaned and sang dismally, catching the ears and lifting the shabby coat-tails of Mr. Mortimer Jenkyn, 'Photographic Artist', as he stood outside and put the shutters up with this own cold hands in despair of further trade. It was 	five minutes to six	.	The Deferred Appointment	Algernon Blackwood

17:57	At 	three minutes to six	, despite there still being no sign of Sally, the director suggested they should all make their way to the Great Hall.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer
17:57	At 	three minutes to six	, a tall, well-built man of military bearing pushed his way through the revolving doors. His dark navy blazer, gray flannels, short hair and highly polished shoes all suggested a life of discipline.	Only Time Will Tell	Jeffrey Archer
17:57	Hugo Carmody had done this, with the result that by 	three minutes to six	 he was feeling as if he had been marooned among roses since the beginning of summer.	Summer Lightning	P.G. Wodehouse
17:57	He would make his way by charm, the charm of voice, of jewel-like language, above all by the intellectual charm of new, moving, luminous ideas. At 	three minutes to six	 the doctor closed the book and waited.	The Drunkard	Guy Thorne
17:58	Then I notice the windows: they're shiny dark. 	17:58	, insists my watch. It can't be. It's only just gone four. I peer around my tormentor's belly to find Immaculée Constantin, but she's gone.	Bone Clocks	David Mitchell
17:59	At 	one minute to six	, the director led the guest of honor onto the stage. He watched the four hundred girls rise and applaud him in what the director would have described as a “ladylike” manner.	Honor Among Thieves	Jeffrey Archer

Say five o'clock?"<br/>"Make it 	six	," the priest suggested. "My office."<br/>"I'll be there," Cork promised.	Iron Lake	William Kent Krueger
18:00	Would a minute have mattered? No, probably not, although his young son appeared to have a very accurate internal clock. Possibly even two minutes would be okay. Three minutes, even. You could go to five minutes, perhaps. But that was just it. If you could go for five minutes, then you’d go to ten, then half an hour, a couple of hours…and not see your son all evening. So that was that. 	Six o’clock	, prompt. Every day. Read to young Sam. No excuses. He’d promised himself that. No excuses. No excuses at all. Once you had a good excuse, you opened the door to bad excuses.	Thud!	Terry Pratchett
18:00	“When did you say you were returning to Amsterdam?”<br>“You know exactly when, because I told you: tomorrow morning.”<br>“Can you get back earlier?”<br>“I could.

18:00	Rick pulled into his driveway, his old Explorer coated in a hazy film of white salt. The winter night had rolled in quickly, the town bathed in darkness by 	six p.m.	 He asked Bill to grab his papers and a bit of weed.	Ohio	Stephen Markley
18:00	As 	six o’clock	 approached, Cryer strolled to the open door of the CAD room. Tom Penny, chewing his lip, was gazing hypnotically at the wall clock.	The Bill 3	John Burke
18:00	“It’s only 	six o’clock	,” he observed with a yawn, and then, in a moment, he made an even more interesting discovery.	The Phantom Tollbooth	Norton Juster
18:00	When is his tea-time? I inquired.<br>"Oh, at 	six o’clock	. He keeps early hours in the country. You had better change your frock now: I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle."	Jane Eyre	Charlotte Brontë
18:00	“What about Nicholas?” Meryl asked as she handed the sheet back to me. I glanced down at the list; there was one space left, the last appointment of the day 	six p.m.	<br>“I’ll pop him down there. Could someone let him know?”<br>“I will,” Meryl said.<br>I pencilled his name in with a question mark.	The Body Lies	Jo Baker
18:00	Dan lay awake until 	six	. Then he dressed and once more made the trek to the Red Apple. This time he did not hesitate, only instead of extracting two bottles of Bird from the cooler, he took three. What was it they used to say? Go big or go home.	Doctor Sleep	Stephen King
18:00	Sometimes the manager would play the role of a customer and test them with questions. Then came the employees’ meal: waiters in this restaurant were not going to have growling stomachs as they took their customers’ order!<br>The restaurant opened its doors at 	six o’clock	, but guests were slow to arrive because of the downpour, and several reservations were simply canceled.	Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami
18:00	But what was my original self? I couldn’t be sure anymore. I couldn’t help feeling that it was another me, another self that strongly resembled my original self. So now what was I to do? I had lost all sense of direction. I shoved my hand into my pocket and fed every piece of change I found there into a pay phone. Eight rings. Nine. And then she answered.<br>“I was sleeping,” she said with a yawn.<br>“At 	six o’clock in the evening	?”	Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman	Haruki Murakami
18:00	Ursula invites me into the wardrobe. “You haven’t aged a day, Timbo, and neither has 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 snaky fellow!” Her furry fawn rubs up against my Narnian-sized lamppost and mothballs . . . but then, as ever, I awoke, my swollen appendage as welcome as a swollen appendix, and as useful. 	Six o’clock	. The heating systems composed works in the style of John Cage. Chillblains burned my toe knuckles. I thought about Christmases gone, so many more gone than lay ahead.	Cloud Atlas	David Mitchell
18:00	At 	6:00 p.m.	 I race home from work and attempt to make myself attractive. Home these days is a tiny bit insanely expensive studio apartment on North Dearborn; I am constantly banging parts of myself on inconvenient walls, countertops and furniture.	The Time Traveler’s Wife	Audrey Niffenegger
18:00	“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for 	six o’clock	?”	The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

18:00	She sounded surprised, and possibly also disappointed. He said, “Listen, I can’t speak for long, so please concentrate on what I’m about to say. I want you to pack a week’s worth of clothes and get the garage to drive you and the children to your parents’ right away.”<br>“But it’s 	six o’clock	.”<br>“They’ll still be open.”<br>“Why do we have to go in such a rush? What’s happened?”<br>“Nothing. Nothing yet, anyway. I just want to know you’re somewhere safe.”<br>“It sounds rather panicky. I hate people who panic.”	Munich	Robert Harris
18:00	Lucinda Quant breaks the story of the big leak on the 	six o’clock	 news. She’s straightforward, she’s believable, and, best of all, she has extensive document trails and video footage. She tells the story about how she came by her treasure trove of dirt, though she doesn’t name names	The Heart Goes Last	Margaret Atwood
18:00	Out along the dim 	six o’clock	 street, I saw leafless trees standing, striking the sidewalk there like wooden lightning, concrete split apart where they hit, all in a fenced-in ring. An iron line of pickets stuck out of the ground along the front of a tangleweed yard, and on back was a big frame house with a porch, leaning a rickety shoulder hard into the wind so’s not to be sent tumbling away a couple of blocks like an empty cardboard grocery box.	One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest	Ken Kesey
18:00	At most times of the day—except during 	six o’clock	 Mass—Dervla could be found spying out of her bedroom window.

19:30	The clock showed 	half-past seven	. This was the twilight time. He would be there now.

19:39	<br>Eva and Braque made $180 at Jack Cermak’s before complains from the nosy wait staff and whiny-ass sore losers forced them out.

Eva actually took two bites, because that’s just who she was.	7:39 P.M.		Kitchens of the Great Midwest	J. Ryan Stradal

19:40	She arrives at 	7.4	0, ten minutes late, but the children, Jimmy and Bitsy, are still eating supper and their parents are not ready to go yet.

19:41	Do you expect to make an arrest? What's to stop this woman from leaving the country?<br/>"Up to now, I'm afraid nothing." And since they knew there wasn't a train until 	7:41	 in the evening, they had all dashed off to the airport in Pisa.	Death of a Dutchman	Magdalen Nabb
19:42	He entered the saleroom at 	7:42	, and took his reserved seat, which he’d selected after some considerable thought. Three rows from the back on the left-hand side.

19:47	<br/>Vance watched as the frigate got off a warning tracer, but to no effect. The Hind ignored it, as a stream of 57mm rockets from under the chopper's stubby starboard wing flared down, while the radar-slaved machine gun beneath the nose opened fire.	7:47 P.M.		Project Cyclops	Thomas Hoover
19:48	On the ride down in the elevator, Fenston was fascinated to see the low estimate for Caillebotte’s Street Sweepers.

The Talented Mr. Ripley	Patricia Highsmith
19:52	<br/>Vance pulled himself across the planking and stretched for a box of gear stowed beneath the stern platform. In it was a constant traveling companion: his chrome-handled 9mm Walther.

21:57	The only two items that stood out on the whole list for Cork were two calls placed from the home of Wilfred Lipinksi, mayor of Aurora, one at 	9:57 P.M.	 and another at 10:41 P.M.

22:00	This was a travelling fair, and we can imagine what a faint impression the public address system might have made against the caterwauling of shrieking teens, the clattering of the roller coaster, the thundering of the waltzer, the hollering of hawkers and hucksters, and the pounding basslines of fairground music.

22:00	At night, a quiet so vast it seemed it seemed almost to reverberate. Few cars passed on Route 114, and after 	ten o’clock	 or so there were none at all. After ten, the part of the world where I had come to rest belonged only to the loons and the wind in the fir trees.	11/22/63	Stephen King

Always some deserted spot, like the Place de l’Estrapade, for example, or those dingy, mournful streets off the Mosque or along that open tomb of an Avenue de Breteuil which at 	ten o’clock in the evening	 is so silent, so dead, that it makes one think of murder or suicide, anything that might create a vestige of human drama.	Tropic of Cancer	Henry Miller
22:00	It was 	ten at night	 and everyone had gone home. I trudged up the dark stairway to clean out my desk.

22:00	At 	ten o’clock	 she went into her double cell, where the woman she shared with was already asleep, and there was the reassuring clang of the door and click of the lock.

22:00	Alone at the too-small child’s desk in her room, Eva finished the last line of the most pointless assignment ever, and though she wanted to start on the evening’s true mission immediately, she kept the box of churro bites closed under her bed.

22:41	The only two items that stood out on the whole list for Cork were two calls placed from the home of Wilfred Lipinksi, mayor of Aurora, one at 9:57 P.M. and another at 	10:41 P.M.

Blood Hollow	William Kent Krueger
22:41	He climbed into the front seat and started the car. It started with a merry powerful hum, ready to go. "There, the bastards", said Julian, and smashed the clock with the bottom of the bottle, to give them an approximate time. It was 	10:41	.	Appointment in Samarra	John O'Hara

22:53	Every time I was there I saw you sitting at the end of the bar all by yourself, hunched over a cup of coffee.

22:56	It was 	about eleven o'clock	. The stars were shining. The wind blew softly and carried the scent of decaying leaves and melting snow from the fields.	The Hammer of God	Bo Giertz

22:59	For the rest of the evening, nobody talked. They just drank, ate, sat in different parts of the shack. Sarah bit her nails, pretended to be busy at the food table. Kendra sat on the couch, her knees pulled up, her head in her arms. Christy stood by the window, examining the rain, her arms crossed, her face pinched.<br>At 	10:59 P.M.	, Kendra’s walkie-talkie beeped.	Reprieve	James Han Mattson
22:59	Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not wake up.

23:00	Shanghai’s clocks were set an hour ahead so the city could "save daylight", but the Bai family said: “We go by the old clock.” Ten o’clock to them was 	eleven	 to everyone else.

23:00	Tony and Zenia are having coffee, as they have done almost every third day now for the past month, ever since they met.

23:00	It was nearly 	eleven o’clock	 when we reached this final stage of our night’s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the west-ward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts.	The Sign of Four	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
23:00	There was no end to it. At first I made all the proper noises to show her I was following along, but soon gave up.

23:00	Around 	eleven o’clock	 the door was unlocked. I readied myself to reject apologies and go for the jugular. A once stately woman sailed in. Seventy years old, eighty, eighty-five, who knows when they’re that old? A rickety greyhound in a blazer followed his mistress.	Cloud Atlas	David Mitchell
23:00	There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.<br>“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”<br>“Nearly 	eleven	.”	The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
23:00	She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding.

23:00	“That priest of yours is really funny. Did you know that they’re allowed to drink, these priests? No women, but alcohol is fine!” Bahar walked in waving Father Mahoney’s order.

At 	eleven at night	!”	Pomegranate Soup	Marsha Mehran
23:00	But time passed, two hours of it, and the less subtle beaux had better learned to focus their pseudo-passionate glances elsewhere, for 	eleven o’clock	 found Isabelle and Amory sitting on the couch in the little den off the reading-room up-stairs.

23:02	I ended the call. I looked in Recents to make sure I HAD called. His number was there, along with the time - 	11:02 P.M.	 I turned off my phone and put it on the night table. I turned off my lamp and was asleep almost at once.	If It Bleeds	Stephen King
23:03	What makes you think it's for real?<br/> "Just a hunch, really. He sounded for real. Sometimes you can just tell about people"-he smiled-"even if you're a dull old WASP."<br/> "I think it's a setup."<br/> "Why?"<br/> "I just do. Why would someone from the government want to help you?"<br/> "Good question. Guess I'll find out."<br/> She went back into the kitchen."What time are you meeting him?" she called out.<br/> "	Eleven oh-three	," he said. "That made me think he's for real. Military and intelligence types set precise appointment times to eliminate confusion and ambiguity. Nothing ambiguous about eleven oh-three."	Little Green Men	Christopher Buckley

23:05	Gates glanced at his clock on the nightstand. It was 	11:05	. "Trey and his friends have probably been done talking about tropical fish for about a half hour. But he's used to me coming home late." She smiled. "So, no rush."	Murderer's Row	Ray Keating

23:11	Life changes fast. Life changes in an instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The Question of self-pity. Those were the first words I wrote after it happened. The computer dating on the Microsoft Word file ("Notes on change.doc") reads "May 20, 2004, 	11:11 p.m.	," but that would have been a case of my opening the file and reflexively pressing save when I closed it.

23:22	At 	11.22	 he handed his ticket to a yawning guard and walked down a long flight of wooden steps to the car-park. A breeze lifted and dropped the leaves of a tree, and he thought of the girl with the blonde hair. His bicycle lay where he had left it.	Dreams of Leaving	Robert Thomson

23:34	. We stand on the sidewalk in front of Jean's apartment on the Upper East Side. Her doorman eyes us warily and fills me with a nameless dread, his gaze piercing me from the lobby. A curtain of stars, miles of them, are scattered, glowing, across the sky and their multitude humbles me, which I have a hard time tolerating.

23:41	In a little while his mind cleared, but his head ached, arms ached, body ached. The phosphorescent figures on his watch attracted his attention. He peered at them. The time was 	11:41	. I remember...what do I remember?	Noble House	James Clavell
